# ontology-conflict-solver
This is the capstone project which is sub component of the author-driven-production project.

Issues:
1) After submmission is done, the task in the task activity becomes green, this should be green after the response comes from the server.
2) Tokens are invalidated from the Firabase after another user login with the same device. This can be rearranged in the home activity.
3) Rarely recyclerview view in the Decision activity does not mark the iterm even if it is selected. So it asks again to the expert to select option.
